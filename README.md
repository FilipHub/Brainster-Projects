Third Brainster project assignment I did is using Laravel, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind and CSS. It's purpose is for collaboration between students with different skill sets (Backend, Frontend, UX/UI, QA, Marketing, Data Science, etc.) where they can create their profile with their qualifications, post project ideas or simply just apply to work on previously posted projects and help bring them to fruition.
